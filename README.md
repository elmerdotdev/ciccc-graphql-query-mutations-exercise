# GraphQL - Query/Mutation Exercise

**Goal:** Create a standalone Apollo Server with CRUD functionality and a sample dataset. Some of the code are already provided, you just have to finish the queries and mutations.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository on your local machine and run `npm i` to install the necessary dependencies.
2. Update the resolvers for `Query` and `Mutation` so that they return the correct data.
3. Test your queries and mutations on the Apollo Server Sandbox which will be on `http://localhost:4000/graphql` by default.
4. Commit and push your changes once you are done.
